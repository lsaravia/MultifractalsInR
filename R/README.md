## Multifractals in ecology using R

This folder have the R scrips and data used in the course.

The following data was taken from [1]

		patch1968.dat
		patch1985.dat

The tiff images files were taken from [2] and converted to sed files using tiff2sed from <https://github.com/lsaravia/SpatialAnalysis>

And the software used for multifractal analysis was <https://github.com/lsaravia/mfsba>
