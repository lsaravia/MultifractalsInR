## Multifractals in ecology using R

This is a post-graduate course given by invitation at the State University of Maring√°, Brasil <http://www.nupelia.uem.br/>. The course is an introduction to fractals and multifractals in other words: power laws and generalized dimensions, with applications to ecology, at the same time I introduce the R statistical lenguaje.
